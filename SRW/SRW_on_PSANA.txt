To install SRW on PSANA:
	git clone --branch reorg https://github.com/Synchrotron-Radiation-Workshop/SRW.git
	cd SRW/python

	# For non-OpenMP:
	python setup.py install

	# For OpenMP
	MODE=omp python setup.py install

To get PSANA working (temporary solution):
	conda activate ana-4.0.11-py3
	source /reg/g/psdm/etc/psconda.sh -py3
	export PYTHONPATH=`pwd`/install/lib/python3.7/site-packages/srwpy-1.0-py3.7-linux-x86_64.egg/

To fix srwpy import issues:
	go to SRW/python/srwpy, and go through the .py files; change all "." in the import section to "srwpy" or "srwpy.".

******ATM: since there is no srwlpy file in srwpy folder, line 6 in srwlib.py fails.
