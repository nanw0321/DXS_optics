Show mirror performance with closed slit to demonstrate resolution.

Show slope error approach/heatload

In a week follow the outline and see what's needed for the report write-up

telescope enlarged; simulate whole beamline

Todo:
	simulate whole beamline with perfect mirrors & WC slit
	introduce slope errors
