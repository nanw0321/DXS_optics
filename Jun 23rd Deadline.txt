Show mirror performance with closed slit to demonstrate resolution.

Show slope error approach/heatload

In a week follow the outline and see what's needed for the report write-up

telescope enlarged; simulate whole beamline

Todo:
	simulate whole beamline with perfect mirrors & WC slit
	introduce slope errors
	Then heatbump simulation with Matt's code

	Lynn's heatload error profile one by one on all optics; then work on compensation


Goal: 
	want the committee to see our device is "real".
		Like closed slit/ half open/ fully open slit
		Results for different bandwidth
		For SRW, just do the 4f simulation since the HHLM+HRM is too memory heavy


Issues now:
	using offset mirrors to collimate the source, the virtual source is 5-20 km away. C2 brings the virtual source closer. For some extreme cases, the virtual source distance is as close as 100m for the elliptical mirrors. So instead of having elliptical mirrors, we would switch to bendable parabolic mirrors.
