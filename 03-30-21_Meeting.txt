SAC meeting, 3 slides. Most ppl are new and know nothing about this project so should be very basic:
	1 Why build this mono: background, requirement, schematics, etc.
	2 Setup + pulse plot "anime" to show basic capability
	3 NERSC computation time/memory limit and goals next step: want to decide engineering requirements;
		table: case & time to explain why we need NERSC
		Future plan: thermal deformation

Advanced research call for proposal:
	Identify observables that cannot be easily detected by human
		machine learning higher-dimensional pattern recognition
		MD simulation glass/polymer dynamics difference under params shown in speckle patterns
		that is: calculate ensemble of speckles
	If successfully get support, it will be computer scientists who support my simulations

	This proposal is to be written by the computing ppl at SLAC/LCLS
