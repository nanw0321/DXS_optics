Things to add to the slides:
	1. Schematic with Telescope and HHLM 
	2. Proof that SRW and Matt's code have the same results.
	3. Simulation results for the full beamline (Telescope + HHLM + HRM) using Matt's code.
	4. And continue our previous simulations with the shapeErrors.

Next, what if we have flexibility in the 4f mirror as well, it would be expensive but how much does it help us?
	1. since the effective source distance after asymmetric reflection is shorter than symmetric, maybe we can change Mir1_p and Mir2_q together and see if the bandwidth is converging/diverging. Our expectation now is that the bandwidth would improve.
	2. Once we find the optimal spot, we can change the asymmetry angle to ~10 degree and scan Mir1_p and Mir2_q again to see how far the optimal point moves.
	3. Since we cannot correct for the shapeError by simply bending m2_p, what if we bend the mirrors in the 4f as well?
