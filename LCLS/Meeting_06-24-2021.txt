This morning Hasan had a review report with some people from APS etc.

In the last review in December, they want to see the simulation of everything.
	- message: we benchmarked Matt's code with SRW and chose the Matt's code to continue.
	- The next review is the comming fall or early next year.


To save time, we can limit the scans to m2_p = 150-200 and double the sampling resolution.

To-do:
	1. everything perfect, find the optimal bending of mirror 2
	2. closed slit with shapeError one at a time
	3. For those that we cannot compensate, reduce the shapeError by 0.5, if still cannot, reduce by 1/3 until we can see the correction.
	4. For those that we can compensate, increase the shapeError by 2, 3 times etc...

	The step 3&4 should give us a comfortable range of power for each HHLM crystal to operate in.
