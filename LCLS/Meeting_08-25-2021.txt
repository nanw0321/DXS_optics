To-do:
	Study on magnification (beam size on 2nd mirror), this gives us some idea on the trade off between tail and resolution.
		pick a few beam sizes for the heat bump (now 2FWHM, try 4, 6, 8 etc..)
	Once finished, add heat bumps and see behavior.

	new HRM choices?

	try calculate phase diff at HRM out
