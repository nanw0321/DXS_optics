To-do:
	Study on magnification (beam size on 2nd mirror), this gives us some idea on the trade off between tail and resolution.
		pick a few beam sizes for the heat bump (now 2FWHM, try 4, 6, 8 etc..)
	Once finished, add heat bumps and see behavior.

	new HRM choices?

	try calculate phase diff at HRM out

To-do:
	make HHLM3 power lower ~ the same scale as HHLM1
	calculate phase difference at HRM output, then maybe the HRM can take slightly higher power?
	limit of HRM?
		1. increase the asymmetry, spread out heatload more and narrower bandwidth acceptance; check ~20 degree

	40-50% beam size full simulation
