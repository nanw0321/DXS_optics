1. Keep all optics long enough but at the same time truncate the beam at 2xFWHM and see what happens.
2. Let less beam profile pass through ~+-0.9xFWHM and etc. by setting the aperture of the 1st mirror to that range.
3. Repeat 2. for other sizes as well and see what size is the optimal condition.


4. double check by observing the beam size after the 2nd mirror for example and see if the tail of the beam is actually cut.
5. check bending only spectrum tails to see how the new crystal profiles compare against the old ones. This simulation doesn't include the effect of the phase corrector so it is a more direct comparison and should reveal more details.
