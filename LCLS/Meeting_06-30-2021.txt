Record the profiles of HHLM and the calculated output diagnostics side by side in a slide.
	before: zig-zag, new: 2DCM

email Matt for help with phase shifter optics.

How much power we can dump on HHLM.

Two options:
	1. correct with phase corrector
	2. reduce asymmetry
		the extreme case would be fully symmetric reflection in the HHLM but the output bandwidth would be very high for the 4f. There might be a balanced point where the output has a power low enough for the 4f but at the same time the power on HHLM is low enough as well.

		keep the incident bandwidth the same and change the asymmtry angle to see where we can tolerate.

		for zig-zag reduce the asymmetry by half and see if correctable increace back half way
		for 2DCM do similar things.
