spectrum tail goes way up with mirror length reduced to 1m. Ask Matt.

try to resimulate 11keV to get rid of aliasing.

Diff photon energies behave differently, like 3/6 degree asymmetry on C1 ...



To-do:
	1. crystal selection for HRM - Mon morning
	2. tolerance scan with shapeErrors applied and corrected.
