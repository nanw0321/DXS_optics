Change the 2DCM-111-220 asymmetry angle 9.0-16.9 so that HRM1 takes about 2.73W @ 80% beam power (so that 2DCM performs identically to the Zigzag).

Debug the weird mono-phase shapes using the 2DCM setup, if it works now, then there's something wrong with how I simulated the phase for the zigzag case.
