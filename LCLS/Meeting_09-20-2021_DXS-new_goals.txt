Future: 3hr workshop for a very large coherence volume

To-do: 
	3x crystal footprint
	alignment
	
assume 40W coming in, and power shifts

Increase the point resolution in bending-power fluctuation simulation.

To-do:
	2xFWHM corresponds to 2.5mm at mirror.
	Can loosen this to 3xFWHM ~ 2.5mm.

	3deg incidence angle on crystals. So crystal- beam size is relatively fixed. engineers are trying to increase crystal footprints from 50mm to 60mm and need to decide if we want 2xFWHM or 3xFWHM.

	Tail trade-off: if 2.5mm = 2xFWHM, we have narrower bandwidth but higher tails; if 2.5mm = 3xFWHM, we have broader bandwidth but lower tails.
