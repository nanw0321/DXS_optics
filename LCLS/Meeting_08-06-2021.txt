Quadratic phase if too large beam size differs and run into grid edges.

To-do:
Phase - 2nd order Legendre poly
	push the simulation to limit for mirror bending + phase corrector case in 10% steps.
	See where does the focal plane spatial spectrum deviates far from the perfect case.


Other cases?
	maybe redistribution of crystal power among HHLM2/3 and HRM1.
