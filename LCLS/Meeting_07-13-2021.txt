To-do:
	220 with ~ 3 degree out angle.
	Scan shapeError ~0.7, 8, 9 to see where the boundary is in terms of the power limitation.

	try to see if adding individual phase differences is different from all shapeErrors on at the same time

	Check the spatial chirp after HHLM4 for all cases using HHLM_only codes


self-seeded
	different photon energies
