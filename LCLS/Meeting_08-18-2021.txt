To-do:
	1. reverse crystal positions if Bragg angle >45 degree.
	2. m2_p and m1_q should theoretically change together, but shift the source back 26m to see if optimized is too different from calculated.
		If not, just use the predicted value as "perfect" and call it a day.
	
	3. double check m2_q when this is done. The previous issue might have been caused by the 26 meter offset in the source position.


To-do:
	1. make the perfect case really perfect and see what the output spectrum looks like (ideally 10^-9 at 20meV).
	2. if not recovered, check zig-zag and see if it's caused by 2DCM
